## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

During the course of the project, I made use of recycler view for many of my activities. I had a few challenges with it at first.
I also have a problem with the actitvity arrangmen. It starts from the main screen instead of the login screen nut this will be fixed

Overall, the project was not the easiest, i was not able to make use of firebase, rather, i hard coded most of my implimentations.
I refered back to a few youtube videos to clear things out which i found myself so offten wanting to. 

I made use of the basics concepts and shown I understand what is going on

Giving the fact that we had few time to complete so many other projects and exams, i used my time to the best it allowed me.
